# CS-499-Senior-Design---Project-Team-J
The repository for the senior design project for Team J in the Spring 2021 semester. 

Notes for the project:

1) We used Java and IntelliJ to complete this project. The project runs on Java versions 10 and 15.
2) The unit tests have been placed in a separate folder, you will need Mockito and a JUnit5 dependency to run the unit tests.
3) The simulation will freeze up if there are too many actors, typically in the 100,000s.
4) The XML files used for testing are located in the XML folder and can be selected from the program.
5) The simulation, by default, will load the LifeSimulation01.xml file.
6) The generate.py file is an XML file generator that allows you to simply input the values and it creates the new XML file for you.
